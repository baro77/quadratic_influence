# Quadratic Influence misc stuff

Support repository for article "TITLE ARTICLE" hosted on Medium: LINK_MEDIUM

* [misc_code.m](https://github.com/baro77/quadratic_influence/blob/master/misc_code.m) contains unleashed Octave code defining _p(y,n,i)_ and _âˆ†p(y,n,i)_ and plotting graphs of the referendum model;

* [BALLOT_PRECOMPUTED_PYs](https://github.com/baro77/quadratic_influence/tree/master/BALLOT_PRECOMPUTED_PYs) is a quite big archive (almost 1GB overall) of precomputed values of _p(y,n,i)_ for the 101 x 1000 x 502 lattice domain defined by:
  * _y_ in (0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 1)
  * _n_ in (1, 2, 3, ..., 1000)
  * _i_ in (0, 1, 2, ..., 501)
