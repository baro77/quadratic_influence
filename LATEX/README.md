# Quadratic Payments with constrained probabilities

## LaTeX rewrite - April, 2021

### Excerpt:

> #### Abstract
>
> Dealing with quadratic payments, marginal probability is usually considered ideally constant, maybe for the sake of initial simplicity. Considering the voting scenario depicted in [Vit19], firstly its math foundations are made explicit. Developing a simple referendum model, more realistic outcome probability and marginal probability qualitative shapes are introduced. Enforcing seemingly reasonable assumptions, quadratic payments are then generalized to take into account these new functions shapes, and the way they are still quadratic is discussed. Closing remarks underline the emerging of trade-off constraints not existing in ideal case.

> Given some new typographic peculiarities, the contents are substantially unchanged apart from a couple of minor additions and some typos corrections:
>
> - subtitle and "tl;dr" substituted by Abstract;
> - sentences citing external URLs slightly modified to use bibliographic engine;
> - added this "Version history" section;
> - in "A generic marginal probability & generalized quadratic payments" section, inversion notation for _f(i)_ and _c(i)_ is now coherent with the rest of the article;
> - in equation (7), added  previously missing _max_ subscript;
> - in last equation before "And the name?" section, generic _∆p(i)_ is now never used in favor of explicit special case _∆p_;
> - "grey" typos corrected with "gray";
> - in the second last equation of "And the name?" section, changed system members order and restored the correct strict inequality
